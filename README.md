agents and distributed artificial intelligence @feup

Multi-agent, customizable simulation of the interactions between bees and wasps.  
Bees try to collect as much nectar from the flowers as possible, while wasps wander around and predate on the bees.  

Runs on Repast Simphony integrated with the SAJaS library.
